# Abstract Data Type<sup>1</sup> Linear List
 
instances
    ordered finite collections of zero or more elements
 
operations
    empty() : return true if the list is empty, false otherwise
    size() : return the list size (i.e., number of elements in the list)
    get(index) : return the indexth element of the list
    indexOf(x) : return the index of the first occurrence fo x in the list, return -1 if x is not in the list
    erase(index) : remove/delete the indexth element, elemnts with higher index have their index reduced by 1
    insert(index, x) : insert x as the indexth element, elements, with index >= index have their index increased by 1
    output() : output the list elements from left to right
 
Linear List can be implemented using the following representations
 
    * Array Representation
    * Linked List Representation
 
<sup>1</sup> Abstract Data Type -  is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
